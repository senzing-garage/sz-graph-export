# template-repository

If you are beginning your journey with [Senzing],
please start with [Senzing Quick Start guides].

You are in the [Senzing Garage] where projects are "tinkered" on.
Although this GitHub repository may help you understand an approach to using Senzing,
it's not considered to be "production ready" and is not considered to be part of the Senzing product.
Heck, it may not even be appropriate for your application of Senzing!

This repository contains exemplar artifacts (files) for Senzing repositories.

GitHub provides support for these artifacts.  As an example, click on the following links on this GitHub repository:

- "Insights" tab > "[Community]" on left-hand navigation bar

## README.md

Although the file you are reading is a `README.md` file, this isn't the style of `README.md` for most projects.
Depending upon the type of repository, the following `README.md` templates may be more appropriate:

Examples:

  1. [template-docker/README.md]
  1. [template-go/README.md]
  1. [template-python/README.md]

## CHANGELOG.md

The contents of the [CHANGELOG]
are meant to be consumed by users of the repository.
As such, they need to know what changes affect them as users.
In general, changes that do not effect users should not be captured in CHANGELOG.md.
For this reason, automatic generation of CHANGELOG.md entries is discouraged.

The format of `CHANGELOG.md` is based on [Keep a Changelog], [markdownlint].
Also, projects adhere to [Semantic Versioning].

## CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

The [CODE_OF_CONDUCT] file describes the social conventions among contributors to the repository.

> A *code of conduct* defines standards for how to engage in a community. It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions. It also outlines procedures for addressing problems between members of your project's community. For more information on why a code of conduct defines standards and expectations for how to engage in a community, see the [Open Source Guide].
